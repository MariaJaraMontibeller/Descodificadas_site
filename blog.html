        <p class="post1">During my internship in the field of bioinformatics in Italy, I stayed in a student residence in Grugliasco (near Turin).
        It was a great experience and I recommend it! 
        The monthly amount was around 500 euros (for a single room). Weekly cleaning was done in the rooms, they offer canteen, gym, games and study space available inside the building itself.

        <p> English is not my firts languange. I was born and raised in Italy until my 10 years old, and after that, I moved wit my family to Brazil.
         Here is not common speak English like in Europe.
         I'm not big fan to study languages, so for me, it is difficult.
         But, for academic life, English is extremily necessary.
         Today I remember my first audio post in English for an academic event. It not my best, but you know: <strong>"done is better than perfect" </strong> 
         I hope this experience motivates you to study English too!</p>
